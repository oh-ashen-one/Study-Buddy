You are resuming a coding session for Study Buddy. Do the following:

1. **SESSION CONTEXT**
   - Read the last 5 git commits: `git log --oneline -5`
   - Check current branch: `git branch --show-current`
   - Show any uncommitted changes: `git status --short`
   - Check what files were recently modified

2. **QUICK SUMMARY**
   Give me a 3-4 sentence summary of:
   - What we worked on last session (based on commits)
   - What the last commit/change was
   - Any incomplete work or TODOs left behind

3. **CODEBASE HEALTH CHECK**
   - Run a quick build check: `npm run build`
   - Note any errors or warnings

4. **READY TO GO**
   End with: "Ready to code. What are we building today?"

Format the response cleanly. Don't dump raw terminal output - summarize it for me.
