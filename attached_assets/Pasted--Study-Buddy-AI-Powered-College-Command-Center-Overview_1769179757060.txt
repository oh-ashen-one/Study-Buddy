# Study Buddy - AI-Powered College Command Center

## Overview
Build "Study Buddy" - an all-in-one web app that helps college students organize their chaotic academic lives. Think Notion + Linear meets a college-specific AI assistant. Dark mode by default, clean/minimal design.

## Tech Stack
Choose whatever you think is best for Replit, but needs to support:
- OAuth (Google/Gmail integration)
- Database for user accounts and data
- OpenAI API integration (Replit's built-in)
- File upload handling (for screenshot OCR)
- External API calls (Google Places, calendar syncs)

## User Onboarding Flow
1. Sign up with any email (no .edu requirement)
2. Ask: What university are you attending?
3. Ask: What's your major?
4. Ask: What year are you? (Freshman/Sophomore/Junior/Senior/Grad)
5. Optional: Connect Gmail for full features
6. Land on main dashboard with AI chat front and center

## Features (Build in This Order)

### 1. AI Chat - PRIMARY FEATURE
- First thing users see: a chat bar asking "You're a college student - what do you need help with?"
- Powered by OpenAI API
- AI has context about: user's university, major, year, schedule (once uploaded), and emails (if connected)
- Can answer questions like:
  - "What's the best way to study for organic chemistry?"
  - "Find me YouTube channels for linear algebra"
  - "What are good resources for LSAT prep?"
- AI dynamically recommends study resources (YouTube, Khan Academy, Coursera, subreddits, etc.) based on their courses
- STEM and Law students get extra-relevant recommendations (AI should recognize these majors and go deeper)
- Users can share AI answers via shareable link

### 2. Schedule Upload
- Two input methods:
  - Screenshot upload → OCR extracts course info → user confirms/edits
  - Copy-paste entire schedule (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C from university portal) → AI parses it
- Extracted data: Course names, course codes, times, professors, locations
- Store schedule in user's profile
- AI chat gains context about their specific courses after upload

### 3. Gmail Integration
- OAuth connection to Gmail
- Permission levels (user chooses how much access):
  - Read-only: AI scans emails, extracts deadlines, suggests to-dos
  - Read + Label: AI marks emails as processed
  - Full access: AI can send emails on user's behalf
- The more access they grant, the more features unlock
- Auto-extraction: When professor emails "Essay due Friday," AI detects this and suggests adding to to-do list
- User approves or dismisses suggested to-dos

### 4. Native To-Do List + Calendar
- Built-in to-do list living inside Study Buddy
- Users can manually add tasks
- AI auto-suggests tasks from Gmail (user approves)
- Each task can have:
  - Due date/time
  - Course association
  - Priority level
  - Email reminder (user sets when to be reminded)
- Calendar view showing all tasks/deadlines
- Sync integrations:
  - Google Calendar (two-way sync)
  - Apple Calendar (export .ics)
  - Notion (API integration)
  - Todoist (API integration)

### 5. Study Spot Finder
- User's university location as center point
- Two types of spots:
  - Off-campus: Pull from Google Places API (coffee shops, public libraries, co-working spaces)
  - On-campus: Crowdsourced from students ("this corner of the library is great")
- Each spot can have:
  - Student ratings/reviews
  - Tags: quiet, wifi, outlets, food nearby, open late
  - Photos
- Students can add new spots for their university
- Filter by: distance, rating, amenities, open now

## Design Requirements
- Dark mode by default (no light mode toggle needed for V1)
- Clean, minimal aesthetic like Notion and Linear
- No clutter - college students are stressed, don't overwhelm them
- Mobile-responsive (many students on phones)
- Fast loading - no unnecessary animations

## Database Needs
- Users table: email, university, major, year, OAuth tokens, preferences
- Schedules table: user_id, courses (JSON or relational)
- Tasks table: user_id, title, due_date, course_id, completed, reminder_time
- Study spots table: name, location, university, type (on/off campus), ratings, amenities, submitted_by
- Shared AI answers table: answer_id, content, shareable_link

## APIs to Integrate
- OpenAI API (use Replit's built-in)
- Google OAuth + Gmail API
- Google Places API (for study spots)
- Google Calendar API
- Todoist API
- Notion API

## Future Features (NOT for V1, just notes)
- Rate My Professor integration (scraping or link paste)
- Apple Calendar native sync
- Professor rating system built into app
- Study groups / friend features
- Mobile app version

## Important Notes
- Free to use for now (no payment system needed)
- Monetization will come later (build with freemium in mind but don't implement yet)
- Error handling: If OCR fails, gracefully ask user to paste instead
- If Gmail connection fails, app should still work with manual to-do entry
- All AI recommendations should be dynamically generated, never manually curated
